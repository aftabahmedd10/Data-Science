It provides methods for making inferences and predictions about populations based on a sample of data. Statistics plays a crucial role in various fields, including science, economics, social sciences, business, and more.\n",

    "Statistics is used in various applications, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Research: Statistical methods are employed in designing experiments, collecting data, and drawing conclusions.\n",
